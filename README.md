# Holiday-Dash
A fun Christmas-Themed game I made with Java Swing. </br>
# Installation 
Download the jar executable and the res folder and store them in the same directory. The game can be lauched my double clicking on the jar executable or by going into the directory via terminal and running the command "java -jar ExecutableName.jar." </br>
# How to Play
From the menu screen, press space to play. The game universe will then come into view. Then press space to begin. The game music will start and your red player will start moving forward. Use the spacebar to dash forward, use the right arrow to shift one lane to the right and the left arrow to shift one lane to the left, you can pause the game at any time by left clicking the pause button in the top left corner [double-click the first time you press it]. The rules of the game are simple. If you are red avoid red blocks, if you are geen avoid green blocks and regardless of your color always avoid trees. Passing through green blocks will make your character green and passing through red blocks with make your character red. Points are awarded for doing one of two things, dashing (pressing spacebar) will earn you 1 point and passing through blocks will earn you ten points. The game progressively gets faster and as a result harder so if at any point you crash a game over page will pop up. The page will display your score and what you crashed into. To try again you can simply press spacebar or you can left click the “Try Again” button.
